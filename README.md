# n2n-encryption
it's a n to n key / string encryption in go

1) type in a string
2) encode
3) this will encode the string using a randomly generated key that's as long as the string is in bytes
4) you can save the string/key in seperate JSON files
5) you can load them as well.

That's all folks for now

TODO:

Create API to go along with this.
